Description:
Here is an example of interaction with a program. It covers about 80% of its functional.
What is going on here:
I tested this program before, so there are some rides in the system already.
Firstly, Sergey asks for his ride history (he got two rides, so
you can see two rides description). Then he asks for the bill of his last ride and gets it.
After that he creates a new ride: he chooses two points from the list his addresses,
chooses car type (Comfort), accept conditions of the ride, and select payment method,
When he creates this ride, drivers with "Comfort" car type get this (only those
who is working now) get this ride as available ride, so they can accept or decline it.
After you can see how different drivers enter their accounts and check available rides,
and only those who is working now and have suitable car type can see this available ride.
After that you can observe other functions: passenger "Ruslan Khakimov" adds and
deletes payment methods, deletes and adds addresses to the list of his addresses. And
Driver "Fedor Krasilnikov" observes his car, update his status.
You can notice that the last printed value is "404". This is a secret command that
tells the program not to save the results of the execution.
